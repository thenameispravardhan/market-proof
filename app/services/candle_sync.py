"""Keep the candle store current so the dataset can price new announcements.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`warehouse_prices` fills px_*/vol_*/ret_/adj_/usable/mover_ from one place:
`AIdataset/stockdata/<SYMBOL>.parquet`. Those files were a one-time export, so
every announcement after the export has no candles to price against — measured
2026-07-31: 7,020 of 12,936 live rows sat at `price_status='no_candles'`, and
that fraction only grows. Filling the columns was never the missing piece; the
candles were.

So this fetches the missing days from Fyers (the same `/data/history` the rest
of the app uses — Fyers-only pricing, no public feed) and appends them to the
exact parquet files the price fill already reads. Nothing downstream changes.

Append, never rewrite: a symbol's file is read, unioned with the new rows,
deduped on `ts`, and written back. On a 2 GB box that is one symbol's history
in memory at a time, not the whole store.
