"""Dataset builder — turns every signal AND every analyzed filing into
an ML training row.

The OutcomeLogger already records coarse outcomes (price at signal,
+5m, +30m). This service goes further: once a signal's reaction window
has fully elapsed (DATASET_HORIZON_MINUTES, default 15), it fetches
1-MINUTE Fyers candles around the signal time and computes the full
price-trajectory vector:

  FEATURES (knowable at trade time / T+1..T+5 — safe model inputs):
    pre-news drift + volume baseline, price/return at T+1..T+5,
    5-minute high/low, MFE/MAE within 5m, time-to-first-1%-spike
    (within 5m), 1m→3m slope, volume surge, VWAP deviation,
    opening-range breakout, volatility-expansion ratio.

  TARGETS (only knowable at T+horizon — training labels ONLY; using
  them as inputs is look-ahead bias):
    close/high/low at the horizon, MFE/MAE over the horizon,
    time-to-peak, retrace-from-peak, time-to-1%-within-horizon,
    and the categorical UP/DOWN/FLAT label.

Plus CONTEXT features on every row: IST minute-since-open and
day-of-week, the concurrent NIFTY 1m/5m move (separates "the stock
moved on news" from "everything moved"), and the stock's 5m return in
excess of NIFTY.

TWO ROW SOURCES share the table:
  signal rows — one per signal_outcomes row (the bot acted or was
    risk-blocked).
  shadow rows — analyzed announcements that never produced a signal
    (noise-filtered, HOLD fallback, stale). These are the NEGATIVE
    examples: a materiality pre-filter model can only learn what NOT
    to trade if the rejected universe is in the dataset. Anchored at
    the analysis timestamp (when the bot COULD have acted).

Everything lands in `dataset_features.features` (JSON) so adding a
feature never needs a schema migration. `/api/dataset` joins this with
announcements + analyses + signals + outcomes + trades into the
exportable training set.

Design constraints (mirrors the OutcomeLogger):
  - PASSIVE: never influences trading; every failure is swallowed and
    recorded in the row's status/note.
  - Fyers-only pricing: candles come through the same fetch_history
    helper the ATR provider uses; no public-feed fallback. No candles
    (Fyers disconnected, symbol unresolvable) → status "no_candles",
    retried up to DATASET_MAX_ATTEMPTS. History comes from the REST
    /data/history endpoint — the WebSocket only carries live ticks.
  - A signal near market close can never get a full horizon window —
    those rows stay "partial" (early features present, targets None).

Backfill efficiency (how "fill the whole history" stays cheap):
  - One history fetch per SYMBOL per batch: fetch_history returns a
    date RANGE, so a single call covers every pending row for that
    symbol in the window — the per-(symbol,day) grouping trick, done
    at the range level. Rows are processed symbol-sorted so the cache
    hits cluster; the cache clears per batch to bound memory.
  - Filings outside the IST session (evenings, weekends — a huge slice
    of the shadow universe) can never have a reaction window. They are
    marked "after_hours" TERMINALLY, before any API call, when
    ENFORCE_MARKET_HOURS is on.
  - Cache-miss fetches are paced by DATASET_FETCH_DELAY_SECONDS to
    stay far inside Fyers' rate limits.
  - `run_full()` loops batches until nothing is pending, exposing
    live progress for POST /api/dataset/backfill?full=true.
