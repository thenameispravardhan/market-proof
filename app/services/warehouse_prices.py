"""Fill price/volume columns for announcements that do not have them yet.

A filing enters the dataset the moment it is collected, with px_*/vol_*/day_*
NULL and price_status='pending'. This fills them from the 1-minute candle store:

    px_pre / vol_pre     the minute before the announcement
    px_t0 / vol_t0       the minute containing it (its CLOSE — never lookahead)
    px_1m .. px_60m      1..15, 20, 30, 45, 60 minutes after
    day_high/low/volume  the session those prices come from
    ret_/mkt_/adj_       returns, market-adjusted against NIFTY 50

PURE SQL, NO PANDAS. The service deliberately has no pandas/numpy — on a 2 GB
box shared with a live trader, importing them for one admin job costs more
memory than the job. Everything below runs inside DuckDB: one pass per symbol
that joins the candle window and pivots it by minute-offset, so peak memory is
one symbol's candles regardless of how many announcements are pending.
