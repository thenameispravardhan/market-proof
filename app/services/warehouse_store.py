"""The single unified dataset: one DuckDB file, one table, one schema.

Everything lives in `announcements` inside data/warehouse.duckdb:

    the 276,115-row historical dataset          (loaded from nse_master.parquet)
    every announcement the live bot has collected (schema-mapped from SQLite)
    every announcement collected from now on      (inserted on arrival)

A DuckDB table rather than a pile of parquet files, because the ask is row-level
inserts as news arrives AND fast analytical queries. Parquet cannot do the
former; SQLite is slow at the latter over 280k rows x 91 columns. DuckDB does
both from a single file, and still streams columns off disk rather than loading
the table into RAM.

IDENTITY. `event_id` is the historical dataset's key and only means anything for
the rows that came from it. The real key is `uid` — exchange + symbol +
announcement time + a content hash — which is stable across both sources and is
what dedupes a live row against a historical one when their ranges overlap.

PRICE COLUMNS. A freshly collected filing has no outcome yet, so px_*/vol_*/
day_* arrive NULL and `price_status` says 'pending'. warehouse_prices.py fills
them once the candles exist. Nothing about ingestion waits for prices.
