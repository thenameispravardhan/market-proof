"""Entry state machine — owns the full lifecycle of ONE entry attempt.

The execution Manager used to place entries with a linear script: build
an IOC marketable-limit, call the backend, persist whatever came back.
That script had no answer for the messy middle — a price that ran away
between signal and order (chasing), two signals for the same symbol
racing each other (double entry), a fill confirmation that arrived on
the order WebSocket but never on REST (or vice versa), a partial fill,
or a market that crashed through the stop inside the fill window.

`EntryManager.execute()` replaces that script with an explicit state
machine. Each approved signal runs as its own asyncio task and moves
through:

    INITIALIZED       signal approved by the risk engine; attempt created
    AWAITING_QUOTE    fetch the freshest bid/ask from the market-data bus
    DRIFT_CHECK       live vs signal price; adverse move beyond
                      ENTRY_MAX_DRIFT_PCT -> RETRACEMENT_WATCH (no order)
    ORDER_ROUTING     IOC marketable-limit to the backend, tagged with a
                      client_order_id (symbol mutex held from here on)
    FILL_MONITORING   wait for the order-WS fill event (fast path)
    RECONCILING       WS silent -> poll REST /orders (slow path)
    PARTIAL_HANDLING  filled < intended -> keep the fill, cancel the rest
    ACTIVE_POSITION   hand over to the TradeManager with the EXACT qty
    EXPIRED           zero fill inside the window -> cancel, NO retry
    REJECTED          broker refused (margin / circuit / suspended), or
                      the symbol mutex stayed contended

Safety features baked into the machine (RISK.md §5):

  * Symbol-level mutex — a second signal for the same symbol while the
    first is routing waits SYMBOL_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS, then rejects with
    SYMBOL_LOCKED. Prevents double entry when NSE and BSE publish the
    same news. RETRACEMENT_WATCH is passive and holds NO lock, so a
    genuinely new signal for the symbol can still trade (E-13).
  * Dynamic risk on partial fills — the position is handed over with
    the FILLED quantity and the ORIGINAL stop. Rupee risk scales down
    with the quantity automatically; no stop recalculation needed.
  * Dual confirmation — the fill is confirmed by the order WebSocket
    (`trades.filled` on the event bus, published by the shared
    reconciler) OR a REST /orders poll at the ORDER_FILL_TIMEOUT mark,
    whichever lands first. Duplicates are deduped downstream by
    broker_order_id (see `order_reconcile.reconcile_order_update`).
  * Live stop-trigger check on fill — if the market is already through
    the stop when the fill confirms, exit immediately at market
    (FLASH_CRASH_EXIT) instead of handing a dead position to the
    TradeManager.
  * Slippage breach — a fill through the limit price (exchange glitch)
    is flattened immediately at market (SLIPPAGE_BREACH) and flagged
    critical.
  * Broker timeout — if place_order itself doesn't answer within
    BROKER_ORDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS the attempt ends as BROKER_TIMEOUT and
    is NEVER retried: a blind retry is how double orders happen.

The machine is deliberately DB-free: it returns an `EntryOutcome` and
the Manager owns persistence + event publishing, mirroring how the
TradeManager / QuoteFeed split their responsibilities. The one seam is
`on_routed`, an async callback fired as soon as the broker acks the
order id so the caller can persist the PENDING trade row — without it
the WS reconciler can't match the fill event to a row.

`RetracementMonitor` (same module — it's the other half of the drift
gate) passively watches drift-blocked signals: if the price pulls back
inside the band within RETRACEMENT_WINDOW_SECONDS it re-arms the signal
via `reenter_cb`; when the window closes it expires it via `expire_cb`.
