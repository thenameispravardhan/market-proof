"""Fyers realtime streaming — live prices + order tracking over WebSocket.

Replaces per-symbol REST quote *polling* (which hammered Fyers' 10 req/s
limit → constant 429s) with the Fyers **data socket** for prices, and adds
the **order socket** for real-time fill tracking. Both are outbound
connections, so they need no public URL — unlike the postback webhook.

How it fits:
  - The data socket publishes ticks into the shared `MarketDataBus`
    (`extra={"source": "fyers_ws"}`), the SAME bus + symbol keys the
    `TradeManager`, Trade page and index ticker already read. Nothing
    downstream changes. `QuoteFeed` then treats those fresh ticks as
    authoritative and skips its REST poll (see `QuoteFeed._tick_all`),
    so the 429s disappear while REST stays as a backstop if the socket
    drops.
  - The order socket funnels every order update through the shared
    `reconcile_order_update` — identical behaviour to the postback
    webhook (match by broker_order_id, mirror the fill into positions,
    publish `trades.filled`), and idempotent so the two can't double-apply.

Threading: the `fyers-apiv3` SDK runs each socket on its own background
thread and fires callbacks there. We capture the asyncio loop in `_run`
and bridge every callback back onto it with
`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`, so all bus writes / DB work happen on
the event loop, never on the SDK thread.

Symbols: the bus is keyed by the bare short name (``THOMASCOOK``) the
managed book uses; the socket needs the full broker id
(``NSE:THOMASCOOK-EQ``). We resolve via `resolve_fyers_symbol` and keep a
reverse map so each tick publishes back under the short key.

Lifecycle mirrors the other services: `start()` launches the background
loop; `stop()` + `wait_until_stopped()` tear it down. The loop lazily
(re)connects when a live Fyers account appears and reconnects when its
access token rotates (detected by re-reading `backend.ws_access_token`,
which the execution manager rebuilds on `broker.token_rotated`).
