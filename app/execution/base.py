"""TradingBackend protocol + the value types the execution layer
passes around.

The four methods every backend implements:

    place_order(signal, symbol) -> OrderResult
        Submit an order derived from a signal. For BUY signals we
        open or add to a long; for SELL we close or short (v1 is
        long-only; the backend treats SELL as "close long").

    cancel_order(broker_order_id) -> bool
        Best-effort cancel. True if the broker acknowledged.

    get_positions() -> list[Position]
        Current open positions. Each position carries a
        strategy_id (so the manager can attribute P&L to a
        strategy) and a last_price / unrealized_pnl that the
        paper backend updates from the MarketDataBus.

    get_order_status(broker_order_id) -> OrderStatus
        Status of a single order. Used by the manager to poll
        PENDING orders that didn't fill within their timeout.

The protocol is duck-typed — there is no `runtime_checkable`
metaclass — so callers can pass any object with these four async
methods. Tests use a `StubBackend` to assert the manager calls the
right method with the right arguments.

OrderResult carries enough state to be persisted to a `trades` row
without the manager having to look up the signal again. OrderStatus
is the return shape of get_order_status — the manager polls it
while the order is in `PENDING`.
