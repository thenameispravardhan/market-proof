"""Trade management — the post-entry half of the workflow.

The execution Manager opens positions. The TradeManager *closes* them:
it watches the quote feed for every open position and exits when the
price hits the stop-loss, the target, or the time-based exit window
closes, and computes realised P&L on the way out. It also backs the
manual "close" / "square-off all" controls on the dashboard.

Flow:

  trade.executed (FILLED, BUY)
      -> load the signal's entry/SL/target levels
      -> register a ManagedPosition, ask the QuoteFeed to watch it
  every QUOTE_REFRESH_SECONDS:
      -> for each managed position, read the latest quote
      -> TIME_EXIT:  exit if now - opened_at >= max_hold_seconds
      -> long:  exit if last <= stop_loss (STOP) or last >= target (TARGET)
         short: exit if last >= stop_loss (STOP) or last <= target (TARGET)
      -> on exit: settle the position (qty -> 0), write a SELL/BUY
         trades row with realised P&L, mark the signal closed, publish
         `trade.closed` (notifications + UI relay pick it up)

Exit execution routes by account: paper exits settle directly in the
DB + the paper backend's in-memory book (the bot IS the paper broker);
LIVE exits go to the real broker first — a marketable-limit order
(bid/ask ∓ EXIT_BUFFER_PCT) that falls back to a MARKET order for any
quantity still unfilled at EXIT_FILL_TIMEOUT. A rejected exit retries
at market with backoff (EXIT_RETRY_MAX attempts); a broker call that
hangs past EXIT_BROKER_TIMEOUT gets ONE market retry, then the
position is flagged CRITICAL (system.error → operator alert) and
retried on the next cycle. The position is only settled locally once
the broker actually confirms (or the account is paper).

Realtime: every managed symbol has a tick listener on the shared
MarketDataBus — the Fyers WebSocket publishes straight into it — so
stop-loss / target / trailing / breakeven checks run ON EVERY TICK,
not on the old 5-second poll. The 0.5s sweep stays as a backstop for
time-based exits, mark-to-market persistence, hydration and the EOD
square-off. Price-triggered exits require a FRESH live tick (younger
than STALE_QUOTE_SECONDS); a frozen feed can never fire an exit at a
stale price — the static stop simply waits for the feed to return.

A 60-second reconciliation loop compares the broker's positions with
the managed book: a position the broker shows flat (manual close in
the Fyers app, margin-call square-off, missed fill callback) is marked
CLOSED_EXTERNAL locally and management stops.

Idempotent and crash-safe: a handler error is logged and the loop
keeps running; a position is only settled once (popped from the book
under the exit path).

Speed-trading rules:
  - TIME_EXIT: every position carries a `max_hold_seconds` (default
    `Settings.MAX_HOLD_SECONDS`). When the window closes we exit at
    the latest REAL price regardless of where price sits vs SL/target.
    Re-armed after a restart from `Position.opened_at`.
  - BREAKEVEN: once profit reaches BREAKEVEN_AT_PCT the stop locks to
    entry ± BREAKEVEN_LOCK_PCT — a winner can't become a loser.
  - CONSOLIDATION exit: profit in the [1%, 2.5%] band while the price
    is pinned inside CONSOLIDATION_RANGE_PCT for the whole window →
    take the small profit, free the capital.
  - STALL exit: a bigger winner (3–6%) whose rate-of-change collapses
    below STALL_ROC_PCT over the window → capture before reversion.
  - Hard stop ALWAYS wins over target when both are true on one tick
    (gap through both → the protective exit is the one that fires).
