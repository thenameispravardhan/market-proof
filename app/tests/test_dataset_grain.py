"""The announcement dataset must honour what it advertises.

Every bug on the Dataset page this session came from one shape: the endpoint
serves two different GRAINS (per-signal and per-announcement) through one set
of query params, and the announcement branch quietly disagreed with the signal
branch about what those params mean.

  - columns were validated against the SIGNAL catalog, so 94 of the 97
    announcement columns were dropped before the query ran and the table
    rendered "—" under correct headers
  - enriched_only was honoured on one branch and ignored on the other
  - action/taken/label were accepted and ignored, handing back UNFILTERED
    rows to a caller who believed they were filtered

Each was invisible: no error, no log, just wrong data. These lock the contract
so the next divergence fails in CI instead of in a training set.
