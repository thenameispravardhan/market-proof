"""Analyzer service: subscribes to `announcements.new` and produces
`analyses` + `signals` rows.

Pipeline (per `announcements.new` event):
  1. Skip if an `analyses` row already exists for `announcement_id`
     (idempotency).
  2. Load the announcement, pick a prompt template (event-type-aware
     via the keyword heuristic, falling back to DEFAULT).
  3. Call DeepSeek; validate the JSON.
  4. Persist an `analyses` row.
  5. Run the rules engine against the analysis dict to get an action.
  6. Compute entry / stop-loss / target / RR (deterministic stub
     for v1 — see `_compute_trade_levels`).
  7. Run a minimal risk check (T1 stub: `confidence > 0`,
     `MAX_SIGNALS_PER_DAY`, etc.). Mark `approved` accordingly.
  8. Persist a `signals` row.
  9. Publish `signals.new` on the event bus. (The /ws relay picks it
     up and broadcasts to UI clients.)

Failures inside `_handle_one` are caught and logged — the service
stays alive across a malformed announcement or a 5xx from DeepSeek.

The service has the same lifecycle as `MonitorManager` (start/stop,
idempotent) and is wired into the FastAPI lifespan (T5 will add the
startup hook; for now there's a `run_forever` entry point for
standalone use).

CONCURRENCY: Announcements are processed in parallel (up to 2 at once)
so a slow LLM call on one filing doesn't block the next one that
arrived in the same tick. The semaphore is bounded to avoid hammering
the DeepSeek API rate limit.

Speed-trading rules (NEW):
  - STALENESS GATE: at step 0.5 (right after idempotency check, before
    the LLM call), if the announcement is older than
    MAX_NEWS_AGE_SECONDS we skip the DeepSeek call, write a placeholder
    analyses row tagged `reason="stale_news"`, and return. This
    implements the "no trades on old queued news" rule — the spike is
    gone, so even a correct analysis won't catch the move.

    WHICH CLOCK (see `evaluate_staleness`, NEWS_AGE_FROM_RECEIPT):
      filed_at (default/legacy) — `now - announcement.filed_at`. Note
        this bundles in the EXCHANGE's own publish lag (measured on live
        data: median ~35s, p90 8-16 min), so it rejects filings for a
        delay the bot did not cause and that cost no alpha.
      received_at (opt-in)      — `now - announcement.received_at`, i.e.
        only the delay the bot is responsible for. Alpha decays from
        PUBLICATION, not submission: before the exchange publishes, no
        one can trade it, so the price hasn't moved. Guarded by
        MAX_NEWS_AGE_ABSOLUTE_SECONDS so a monitor outage (whole backlog
        "received just now") can't fake freshness.
  - STARTUP SWEEP: when `Service.start()` runs we also pre-mark every
    announcement older than the threshold that has no analyses row.
    This protects against replay paths (a future manual replay tool, a
    bus redelivery, a stray cron job) firing the LLM on the backlog.

    TWO CLOCKS
    ----------
    legacy (from_receipt=False): age = now - filed_at.
        `filed_at` is the exchange's stated filing time, which bundles in

        PUBLICATION, not submission — before the exchange publishes a
        filing nobody can trade it, so the price has not moved and the
        edge is intact no matter how long the exchange took.

        Guarded by `absolute_max_age_s` on filed_at, which is what stops
        the receipt clock from being fooled: if the monitor was down for
        an hour, the whole backlog is "received just now" and would look
        fresh. The absolute ceiling rejects it. Set 0 to disable the
        ceiling (not advised).

    block (the legacy gate also skipped when filed_at was None) — the
