"""NSE corporate announcements monitor.

NSE publishes corporate announcements on a single page that's largely
server-rendered, but the table is hydrated by an XHR call. We hit the
XHR endpoint for stability and a smaller payload, and we fall back to
the page itself if the XHR fails.

Endpoints:

  - https://www.nseindia.com/companies-listing/corporate-filings-announcements
  - https://www.nseindia.com/api/corporate-announcements?index=equities
    (the XHR the page hits; requires the cookies set by the landing
    page to be present on the request)

For the parser we work with the JSON shape NSE's XHR returns::

    [
      {
        "symbol": "RELIANCE",
        "sm_name": "Reliance Industries Limited",
        "desc": "Reliance Industries Limited - Board Meeting Intimation",
        "attchmntFile": "https://nseindia.com/.../XYZ.pdf",
        "fileSize": "123.4 KB",
        "an_dt": "15-Jan-2026 09:30:00"
      },
      ...
    ]

The parser is deliberately tolerant: missing fields are skipped, not
raised. Date strings are localised and may arrive in `dd-MMM-yyyy`
format (e.g. "15-Jan-2026") or `dd-MMM-yyyy HH:MM:SS`; we normalise to
UTC datetimes. If a row's `posted_at` is unparseable we drop it.
