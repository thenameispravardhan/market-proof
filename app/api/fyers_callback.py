"""Fyers OAuth callback endpoint.

GET /api/fyers/callback?auth_code=<code>&state=<state>

Validates `state` (one-shot CSRF nonce), then exchanges the
`auth_code` for an access_token via Fyers' `validate-authcode`
endpoint. The token is stored on the `broker_accounts` row whose
`app_id` matches the FYERS_APP_ID env var. (For multi-account
operators, we look up by app_id first, then by redirect_uri.)

The access_token is NEVER logged. The `set_access_token` log line
in `FyersClient` only logs the count, not the value.

Errors:
  - 400 if `code` or `state` is missing.
  - 400 if `state` is not in the expected-states registry (CSRF).
  - 502 if the Fyers token exchange fails.
  - 404 if no matching broker_accounts row is found.

Returns a tiny HTML page on success so the operator can close the
tab. JSON is also returned under `application/json` accept.
